          First, a disclaimer – the entire process of writing a blog post often
          takes more than a couple of hours, even if you can type eighty words
          per minute and your writing skills are sharp. From the seed of the
          idea to finally hitting “Publish,” you might spend several days or
          maybe even a week “writing” a blog post, but it’s important to spend
          those vital hours planning your post and even thinking about Your Post
          (yes, thinking counts as working if you’re a blogger) before you
          actually write it.
        </p>
        <p class="txt-gray">
          There’s an old maxim that states, “No fun for the writer, no fun for
          the reader.” No matter what industry you’re working in, as a blogger,
          you should live and die by this statement.
        </p>
        <p class="txt-gray">
          Before you do any of the following steps, be sure to pick a topic that
          actually interests you. Nothing – and I mean NOTHING – will kill a
          blog post more effectively than a lack of enthusiasm from the writer.
          You can tell when a writer is bored by their subject, and it’s so
          cringe-worthy it’s a little embarrassing.

          I can hear your objections already. “But Dan, I have to blog for a
          cardboard box manufacturing company.” I feel your pain, I really do.
          During the course of my career, I’ve written content for dozens of
          clients in some less-than-thrilling industries (such as financial
          regulatory compliance and corporate housing), but the hallmark of a
          professional blogger is the ability to write well about any topic, no
          matter how dry it may be. Blogging is a lot easier, however, if you
          can muster at least a little enthusiasm for the topic at hand.

            It’s no doubt that when a development takes longer to complete,
            additional costs to integrate and test each extra feature creeps up
